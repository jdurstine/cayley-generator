# Overview

cayley-generator is a work in progress tool to visualize and study the properties of group actions of groups generated by a finite set of functions.

The tool currently works by taking some finite set of functions and their inverses, along with a basis for each function to generate a graph which can act on a supplied initial value.

A standard example of such a graph is given by two functions which when composed with one another form a group. Using this tool along with Cytoscape the visualization of such a group on two functions was created:

The tool allows one to act on an initial value giving to every node in the graph a value which can then be used to add extra elements to the visualization of the group (like the red and blue coloring above) or provide a starting point for analyzing relations between the different nodes.
